## ðŸŒ³ OpenQ Hackathons

This repository is an informative directory and tool to coordinate future OpenQ hackathons that will be paid out through OpenQ.

Each hackathon series is described via a GitHub issues. Look at open issues to find contests that are still open and create a submission via pull-requests to win them.

**Rules**
- OpenQ is constantly reviewing new hackathon submissions from different organizers, we do not accept any submission that is very similar to an old one. However, if you haven't managed to submit your project to a hackathon, you are welcome to do so at OpenQ
- You will own any developments made by you, and all right, title and interest in those developments, including the intellectual property rights therein, shall belong to you
- You acknowledge that these contests are intended to be competitions where ideas are shared freely, and therefore acknowledge that any information that you share with other participants and the organization
- OpenQ has the unrestricted right to use any information you have provided in your submission to distribute it on social media, via email and on the website


**Rules on Pre-existing Work**

Existing projects cannot be submitted; however, you are free to start working on them as soon as the contests begins.
If you participated in a hackathon that OpenQ was also involved in and did not manage to submit your project, you can also do so via this format if the hackathon took place during the contest period.

No work should be done on your project before the contest starts. This applies to programming, asset creation, etc. Each hack entry will be judged solely on the quality of work done during the hackathon. If a project or team is porting or continuing an existing project, you may enter but not be eligible for the price.
